- indentation based on block structure
- convert TOON buffer to JSON via the `toon` CLI
- pretty-print buffers (pure Emacs Lisp; no external dependencies)


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Token-Oriented Object Notation is a compact, human-readable encoding of the
JSON data model that minimizes tokens and makes structure easy for models to
follow.  It's intended for LLM input as a drop-in, lossless representation of
your existing JSON.
